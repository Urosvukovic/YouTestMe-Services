	          Data digitalization and loading
	        </h2>
	        <p>
	          We can save you countless hours of entering content by preloading the
	          purchased products with your data, thus providing you with a
	          ready-to-use system. If your data is in paper format, we can easily
	          transfer it and load it into any of our products in no time at all.
	          The digitization process includes loading:
	        </p>
	        <ul>
	          <li>
	            Users
	          </li>
	          <li>
	            Tests

	            Answers
	          </li>
	        </ul>
	        <p>
	          Pricing depends on the amount of data that needs to be loaded, whereas
	          you pay only for what you use.
